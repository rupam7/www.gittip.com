"""This is Gittip's payday algorithm. I would appreciate feedback on it.

The payday algorithm is designed to be crash-resistant and parallelizable, but
it's not eventually consistent in the strict sense (iinm) because consistency
is always apodeictically knowable.

Exchanges (moving money between Gittip and the outside world) and transfers
(moving money amongst Gittip users) happen within an isolated event called
payday. This event has duration (it's not punctiliar). It is started
transactionally, and it ends transactionally, and inside of it, exchanges and
transfers happen transactionally (though the link between our db and our
processor's db could be tightened up; see #213). Exchanges immediately affect
the participant's balance, but transfers accrue against a "pending" column in
the database. Once the payday event has completed successfully, it ends with
the pending column being applied to the balance column and reset to NULL in a
single transaction.
